# Region data-root wiring: the two things that stamp a region's pinned data root onto a worker —
# the `RemoteTarget.datadir` field and the cold-spawn boot script that exports it as
# `KAIMONSLATE_DATADIR` (src/remote.jl). Pure/local — no ssh, no workers. The receiving
# half (`datadir()` / `__slate_materialize_datadir` resolving the same env) lives in the
# worker process, exercised by the manual remote round-trip, not here. (Region defs themselves
# are covered in test_remote_pool.jl's registry testset.)
